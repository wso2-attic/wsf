<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">This document is intended to be a reference
manual for <a href="http://ws.apache.org/rampart/c">Apache Rampart/C</a>.</p>
<p>For further details on Axis2/C please refer the <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/c/docs/axis2c_manual.html">Apache Axis2/C manual</a></p>

<h2>Simplified Architecture</h2>

<p>In a very simple view, Rampart/C consists of a core module and packages
related to WS-Security and WS-Security Policy. For XML-Encryption and
Signature Rampart/C uses OMXMLSecurity. Both Rampart/C and OMXMLSecurity uses <a
href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/c/docs/om_tutorial.html">Apache AXIOM</a> and
Axis2-Util libraries. OpenSSL is used as the crypto library in
OMXMLSecurity.</p>

<h2>Interface with Axis2/C</h2>

<p>The interface between Rampart/C and Apache Axis2/C engine is the Rampart
module called mod_rampart. The module has two handlers, one for the inflow
and another for the outflow of the Axis2/C engine. Rampart/C directs messages
to it's other components for further security related processing using these
handlers. </p>

<p>Handlers are a way of extending capabilities of the core engine. Once the
Axis2/C engine calls the invoke() method of the handler, the module can do
the necessary processing over the SOAP message. Rampart/C use this mechanism
to build/process security related SOAP headers.</p>

<h2>Inside Rampart/C</h2>
Following is a detailed architecture diagram of Rampart/C
<p><img src="files/rampart_archi.png"></p>

<h3>Rampart Engine</h3>

<p>Rampart engine is the heart of Rampart/C. It sets security policies that
defines the behavior of Rampart/C message processing. These policies are
usually read from a selected policy.xml file depending on the message flow,
which contains a set of policy assertions.</p>

<h3>Processors and Builders</h3>

<p>Rampart/C processes incoming SOAP message using it's processors. There are
two processors in Rampart/C.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Security Header Processor</strong> : Processes security header
    of the incoming message and make decisions upon security claims and the
    security policies.</li>
  <li><strong>Token Processor</strong> : Processes token claims such as
    binary security token.</li>
</ol>
Similar to processes, Rampart/C uses two builders that builds outgoing
messages.
<ol>
  <li>Security header builder : Builds Security headers of an outgoing
    message depending on security policies.</li>
  <li>Token Builder : Builds token claims such as binary security token.</li>
</ol>
These builders and processes assemble other components such as encryption,
signature, UsernameToken together. Decisions are taken in these processes
would result in further processing of the message or throwing of a  SOAP
fault.

<h3>Policy</h3>

<p>The policy module of Rampart/C acts as the configuration module in
Rampart/C. The policy module has a set of models that represents assertions.
Also there are set of builders that builds these models. <br>
</p>

<p>Rampart/C is configured using policy assertions defined in WS-Security
Policy specification 1.1. These policies are defined in policy.xml files.
There are two policy files for a single Rampart configuration.</p>
<ol>
  <li>incoming-secpolicy.xml</li>
  <li>outgoing-secpolicy.xml</li>
</ol>
The former defines how an outgoing message is secured, whilst the latter
defines how the incoming message should be secured. Apart from the assertions
mentioned in the specification, Rampart/C uses it's own assertions. (e.g. To
specify keys and certificates). There are number of such sample policy files
under rampart/samples/secpolicy.


<h3>Rampart utilities</h3>

<p>Rampart utilities groups different entities that cater for different
purposes.  Following is a brief description of major components inside
utilities</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rampart context:</strong> Keeps configurations for Rampart/C.
    This includes certificates, keys, passwords, policies etc.</li>
  <li><strong>UsernameToken: </strong>Provides functionalities to
    build/process a UsernameToken.</li>
  <li><strong>TimestampToken: </strong>Provides functionalities to
    build/process  a TimestampToken.</li>
  <li><strong>Authentication provider: </strong>The interface for
    authentication modules that can be plugged into Rampart/C. This allows
    users to define their own rules for processing user name / passwords.</li>
  <li><strong>Credentials provider: </strong>An interface for a credentials
    module to be plugged in. Users can provide custom user name/password
    pairs to build user name tokens.</li>
  <li><strong>Password callbacks: </strong>An interface for users to provide
    password for a given user name.</li>
</ul>

<h2>OMXMLSecurity</h2>

<p>For XML cryptographic purposes Rampart/C uses OMXMLSecurity, which is a
library written on top of Apache AXIOM. If a particular SOAP message needs to
be encrypted or signed, Rampart/C get the work done through the
OMXMLSecurity. Following are the functionalities of OMXMLSecurity.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>XML-Encryption / Decryption:</strong> This includes symmetric
    and asymmetric encryptions. Usually data is encrypted using a symmetric
    key (or a session key) which is again encrypted using an asymmetric
    algorithm using a public key.</li>
  <li><strong>XML-Signature  / Verification:</strong> Allows one or more part
    of an XML document to be signed using a private key. Also allows these
    signed parts to be verified.</li>
  <li><strong>Key management:</strong> To load X509 certificates, Private
    keys etc, the Key management interface provide a series of functions.
    Keys might be stored in PEM files, PKCS12 key stores or can be in string
    buffers.</li>
  <li><strong>Canonicalization:</strong> Provide Canonicalization (C14N)
    transform support.</li>
  <li><strong>Creating/Processing tokens:</strong> There are number of XML
    elements that are introduced by security specifications. The token base
    in OMXMLSecurity provides functionalities to create/process such
  elements.</li>
</ol>
