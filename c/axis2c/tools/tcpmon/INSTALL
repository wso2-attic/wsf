Getting Axis2/C tcpmon Source Working on Linux
=============================================
Build the source
This can be done using the following command sequence:
        ./configure
        make
        make install
        use './configure --help' for options

NOTE: If you don't provide a --prefix configure option, it will by default 
install into /usr/local/tcpmon directory.
