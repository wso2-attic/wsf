1. Installing and Running on Linux.
===================================

1.1 Using the source release.

    The following steps need to be taken to install and run Axis2/C using source 
    distribution on Linux. Build depends on

    a) libssl-dev
    b) libsqlight3-dev
    c) libxml2-dev
    d) pkg-config
    e) libiksemel-dev (If you enable xmpp)

    1. Extract the source tar package to a folder.
    2. Set WSFC_HOME environment variable pointing to the location where you 
       want to install WSO2 WSF-C. 

        * WSFC_HOME='/your_desired_path_to_axis2c_installation'
        * export WSFC_HOME

    3. Then go to the folder where you extracted the source.
        
        * cd /your_path_to_wsf-c_source

    4. Build the source
        * This can be done using the following command sequence in the directory 
          where you have extracted the source

            *  ./configure --prefix=${WSFC_HOME}
            * make
            * make install
            * make samples 

            Use './configure --help' for possible command line options.

           Note :If you do not provide a --prefix configure option, it will 
           by default be installed into /usr/local/wsf_c directory.

     5. Go to where you installed WSO2 WSF-C.

        Start simple axis server

        * To start the simple axis server on port 9090 run the following command lines

            cd ${WSFC_HOME}/bin
            ./axis2_http_server

            To see the possible command line options run ./axis2_http_server -h
            Note : If you run into shared library problems, try setting the 
            LD_LIBRARY_PATH

            export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/your_path_to_wso2_wsf-c/lib

            Run the wsclient in a new shell

            cd /your_path_to_wso2_wsf-c/bin

            ./wsclient

            To see the possible command line options run ./wsclient --help or ./wsclient -h

            Ex: ./wsclient --soap http://localhost:9090/axis2/services/echo < ../resources/echo.xml
           

2. Installing and Running on Microsoft Windows (win32)
======================================================

This can be done using either binary or source distribution.
For both the binary and source distributions, you need to download libxml2.

(NOTE: most Linux systems have libxml2 by default. On MS Windows you need to 
download and install libxml2)

2. 1. Using Binary Release

2.1.1. Requirements

    The binaries shipped with this version are compiled with Microsoft Visual 
    Studio Compiler (cl)

    (Note: you can download Microsoft VSExpress2005 edition from the Microsoft 
    Web site and install it to run thse binaries)

    You also need the following dlls:

    * libxml2.dll [http://www.xmlsoft.org - download the version >= libxml2-2.6.20.win32]
    * iconv.dll [http://www.xmlsoft.org - download the version >= iconv-1.9.1.win32]
    * zlib1.dll [http://www.xmlsoft.org - download the version >= zlib-1.2.3.win32]


2.1.3. Running The Binaries

    1. Copy libxml2.dll, iconv.dll and zlib1.dll downloaded to C:\wsf-c\lib
    2. Extract the binary distribution to a folder of your choice. (example: C:\wsf-c)

    you need to set a couple of environment variables before you can 
    run the server and wsclient.

        * Set the variable WSFC_HOME to the deploy folder (C:\wsf-c)
        * Add the path to lib directory to the PATH variable (%WSFC_HOME%\lib)

    Now everything is set to run the server (C:\axis2c\bin\>  axis2_http_server.exe)

    If the server is running successfully you should see the message 
    "Started Simple Axis2 HTTP Server..."

    (Note: You may provide command line options to change the default behaviour. 
    Use the command "axis2_http_server.exe -h" to learn about the usage)

    Run the wsclient in a new DOS shell

    cd c:\wsf-c\bin

    wsclient wsclient.exe

    To see the possible command line options run ./wsclient --help or wsclient.exe -h

2.2 Using the Source Release

2.2.1. Requirements
   
    The makefile shipped with this version needs Microsoft Visual Studio 
    Compiler (cl) and nmake build tool.

    (Note: You can download Microsoft VSExpress2005 edition and Platform SDK 
    from Microsoft Web site. You will need to add the path to Platform SDK 
    Include and Lib folders to makefile)

    You also need

    * libxml2 [http://www.xmlsoft.org - download the version >= libxml2-2.6.20.win32]
    * iconv [http://www.xmlsoft.org - download the version >= iconv-1.9.1.win32]
    * zlib [http://www.xmlsoft.org - download the version >= zlib-1.2.3.win32]

2.2.3. Editing configure.in File

    The default paths for libxml2 and iconv are specified in configure.in

    Example:Default location for libxml2 is C:\libxml2

    You can either extract libxml2 to this folder, in which case folder 
    structure for C:\libxml2 should look like the following:

    Or extract to a location of your choice and edit the configure.in accordingly.

    You need to have zlib1.dll in a library path. You may copy this dll to libxml2/lib.

2.2.4. Compiling The Source

    The following steps will take you through the source compilation

        Extract the source distribution to a folder of your choice. (Example: C:\axis2c)
        Open a DOS shell
        cd C:\axis2c\build\win32

    to access .Net tools, run

        C:\axis2c\build\win32> vcvars32.bat

    (Note: You may need to set the PATH environment variable to vcvars32.bat if 
    Windows complaints that it cannot find this bat)
    build the system and create a directory named deploy under build directory:

        C:\axis2c\build\win32>nmake install

2.2.5. Running The Binaries

    You need to set couple of environment variables before you can run the 
    server and samples.
    Set the variable WSFC_HOME to the deploy folder (C:\axis2c\build\deploy)
    Add the path to lib directory to PATH variable (%WSFC_HOME%\lib)
    Copy libxml2.dll, iconv.dll and zlib1.dll to axis2c lib folder (%WSFC_HOME%\lib)
    Now run the server - C:\axis2c\build\deploy\bin>  axis2_http_server.exe
    If server is running successfully you should see the message "Started Simple Axis2 HTTP Server..."
    (Note: you may provide command line options to change the default behaviour. 
    Use the command "axis2_http_server.exe -h" to learn about the usage)

    Run the wsclient in a new DOS shell

    cd c:\wsf-c\bin

    wsclient.exe

    To see the possible command line options run ./wsclient --help or wsclient.exe -h
