VERSION
-------
1.0.0


INTRODUCTION
------------
- WSF/Ruby is the Ruby language extension to WSO2 WSF/C
  [http://www.wso2.org/projects/wsf/c]. This version enables you 
  to write client/service applications to consume/provide Web Services 
  respectively.


PREREQUISITES
-------------
- It is required to have WSO2 WSF/C installed in your machine 
  in order to compile and use this extension module.


CONFIGURATION
-------------
- The following configuration entries have to be added to the 'rbconfig.rb'.
  (under windows use '/' to seperate directories. e.g. "E:/install/wsfc")
  
  CONFIG["WSFC_HOME"] = "/your/wsfc/home/"
  CONFIG["WSF_LOG_DIR"] = "/where/the/log/files/should/reside/"
  CONFIG["WSF_LOG_LEVEL"] = "5"
    
	Valid Log Levels - 
	      "0" - CRITICAL
		  "1" - ERROR
		  "2" - WARNING
		  "3" - INFO
		  "4" - DEBUG
		  "5" - TRACE

    NOTE : Type "ruby -e 'puts $:'" in a console to find where this file is.
           It's /usr/local/lib/ruby/1.8/i686-linux/rbconfig.rb in my case.
